UC1: Application Entry & Welcome Message
-
The objective of the PalindromeChecker App is to design and implement a console-based Java application that validates whether a given string is a palindrome under different conditions, while strengthening core programming fundamentals and data structure concepts.

**Goal -** Display a welcome message and app details at startup. The goal is to establish a clear startup workflow

**Description -**
The PalindromeCheckerApp class represents the entry point of the Palindrome Check App

**Actor:** User

**Flow:**
1) Program starts.
2) JVM invokes the main() method.
3) Application name is displayed.
4) Application version is displayed.
5) Program continues to next use case or exits. 

**Key Concepts used in UC1:**
1) Class – Acts as a container for the Palindrome Checker application logic.
2) Main Method – Entry point of the Java application with the signature
3) public static void main(String[] args).
4) Static Keyword – Allows the JVM to invoke the main() method without creating an object.
5) Console Output – System.out.println() is used to display messages on the console. 
6) Application Flow Control – Defines the startup behavior before palindrome processing begins.
